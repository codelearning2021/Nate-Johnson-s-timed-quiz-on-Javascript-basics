# Module-4-Challenge-Nate-Johnson

## Description
For this assignment, I created a simple quiz with a few questions about Javascript with a 60 second timer. The user can check their answer but if they're incorrect, they are docked time (5 seconds) from the timer. They are asked for their initials and can see their score following the completion of the timer/quiz.
